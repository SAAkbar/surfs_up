# surfs_up

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to gather the temperatures for the month of June and December to help W. Avy to determine if he could open up a year long surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. To do that we got the weather data in SQLite, then using python and Jupiter notebook we were able to query the data for just June and December and finally were able to create a summary statistics table.

## Results

Looking at the tables we can see 

•	The Average in June is 74.94 and in December it is 71.04, a difference of 3.9 

•	The min in June is 64 and in December it is 56, a difference of 8

•	The max in June is 85 and in December it is 83, a difference of 2

## Summary
After looking at the temperatures it is safe to say that shop can stay open year-round as the average in temperature is only 3.9 in difference, and while the min is lower by 8 the max is only higher by 2. The standard deviation for both are also close as they are 3.25 for June and 3.75 for December, even the 25%, 50%, and 75% values are only different by 3 or 4 so it is safe to say that the temperature is roughly the same just a few degrees lower, with both being suitable for ice cream and surfing.
Something that might help with this analysis is if we also look at the precipitation for June and December, as precipitation might be different and can definitely affect the willingness to go out and eat ice cream or surf. The quires and tables below will help paint a better picture. By looking at these two new tables we can see that the precipitation levels were just a little bit more in December compared to June but again they were close enough to let us know that a surf and ice cream shop be open full year-round.
